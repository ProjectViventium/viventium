# 39. Installer and Config Compiler

## Purpose

This document is the public installer source of truth for the `./install.sh` and `bin/viventium`
paths, plus the generated-runtime boundary enforced by the config compiler.

## Owning Flow

1. `./install.sh` clones or refreshes the repo checkout, then execs `bin/viventium install`.
2. `bin/viventium install` owns the public first-run flow:
   - wizard/config selection
   - preflight prerequisite detection and install
   - component bootstrap
   - config compilation
   - doctor validation
   - helper install
   - detached local startup plus health wait
3. Generated runtime files are written under `~/Library/Application Support/Viventium/runtime/` and
   are outputs, not authoring surfaces.

## Installer UX Requirements

- The primary startup wait UI must stay honest:
  - elapsed time
  - current startup step
  - which required surfaces are still pending
- Interactive TTY installs may render a second, playful tagline line below the truthful status line.
- The playful line must never replace the real health/status line or hide an actual failure.
- Headless and non-interactive installs stay on plain repeated progress logs only.
- Installer copy must remain public-safe and hardcoded from product code:
  - no secrets
  - no personal data
  - no machine-specific jokes or runtime-derived private state
- Animation contract for the playful line:
  - fast type-in effect
  - hold around five seconds once fully shown
  - rotate randomly
  - avoid immediately repeating the same line

## Config Compiler Boundary

- The config compiler still owns generated runtime artifacts such as:
  - `runtime.env`
  - `runtime.local.env`
  - `librechat.yaml`
- Installer UX affordances, including wait copy and inline animations, must not mutate or depend on
  generated App Support outputs to appear correct.

## Learnings

- First-run startup can honestly take minutes because local package builds and optional Docker sidecars
  are real work, especially on a clean machine.
- Playful wait copy is acceptable when the deterministic status path remains visible and reliable.
- The right ownership layer for this feature is the public CLI wait loop in `bin/viventium`, not
  generated runtime files, LibreChat prompts, or machine-local App Support state.
