# Modern Playground Voice Cases

## MPV-001 Authenticated Call Launch

- Requirement: `docs/requirements_and_learnings/06_Voice_Calls.md`
- User Outcome: An authenticated chat can open a valid modern-playground call session and the voice
  agent joins instead of leaving unexpectedly.
- Surfaces: LibreChat Web UI, Modern Playground, LiveKit, Voice Gateway
- Preconditions: canonical local stack running; authenticated Viventium user; synthetic
  non-personal chat available.
- Steps:
  1. Open an authenticated LibreChat agent conversation.
  2. Click the phone button.
  3. Verify the modern playground opens with a call-session deep link.
  4. Click `Start chat`.
  5. Open transcript and send a synthetic typed prompt.
- Expected Result: LiveKit connects, the voice worker receives the job, and the assistant returns a
  real answer. Forbidden result: `Session ended / Agent left the room unexpectedly`.

- Last Run: see latest dated execution evidence in `README.md`.

## MPV-002 Local Whisper Exact-Model Self-Heal

- Requirement: `docs/requirements_and_learnings/06_Voice_Calls.md`
- User Outcome: Local Whisper voice calls preserve the user-selected Whisper.cpp model and repair
  missing or corrupt local model artifacts instead of silently changing models.
- Surfaces: Modern Playground, Voice Gateway capability API, Voice Gateway startup, Telegram local
  transcription helpers
- Preconditions: canonical local stack running with `VIVENTIUM_STT_PROVIDER=whisper_local` or
  equivalent local `pywhispercpp` route.
- Steps:
  1. Query the voice gateway capabilities endpoint.
  2. Open `http://localhost:3300` in a real browser.
  3. Inspect the Listening selector and its dropdown.
  4. Seed a stale generated runtime env with a different local STT model, then start through the
     supported launcher and verify canonical `config.yaml` wins.
  5. Corrupt or remove the cached selected model in a synthetic/temp cache and run the model
     self-heal check across voice gateway and Telegram local transcription helpers.
  6. Check the voice gateway startup log for the selected model preflight and prewarm.
- Expected Result: Current STT preserves the selected local model, including `large-v3-turbo` when
  selected. Missing or corrupt cache files are re-downloaded for that exact model and load-validated
  before worker use. Stale generated runtime env is regenerated from canonical config before launch.
  Forbidden result: runtime silently changes the selected model to `base.en`, `small`, OpenAI STT,
  or any other route to hide the local Whisper.cpp problem.
- Evidence: `qa/modern-playground-voice/README.md#2026-05-12-local-whisper-model-route-regression`
- Last Run: 2026-05-12, updated after exact-model self-heal fix.
